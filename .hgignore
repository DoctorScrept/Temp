# You can add the following files to Visual Studio source control:
#	Solution files (*.sln).
#	Project files, for example, *.csproj, *.vbproj, .*proj files.
#	Application configuration files, based on XML, used to control run-time behavior of a Visual Studio project.
# Files that you cannot add to source control include the following:
#	Solution user option files (*.suo).
#	Project user option files, for example, *.csproj.user, *.vbproj.user files.
#	Web information files, for example, *.csproj.webinfo, *.vbproj.webinfo, that control the virtual root location of a Web project.
#	.ncb (something to do with browsing or intellsense)
#	Also, don't put in any object files, executables, auto-generated files (like headers that might be generated), Build output files, for example, *.dll and *.exe files.
# As for executables and other generated files - there might be an exception if you want to be able to archive releases. That might be a good idea, but you'll probably want to manage that a little differently and possibly in a different place than your source code. If you do this, also archive your .pdb files so you can debug the stuff later. you might want to use a Symbol Server to store you archived symbols (see Debugging Tools for Windows for the symbol server and its documentation).
